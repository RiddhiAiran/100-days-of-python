# 🏝️ Treasure Island Adventure - Streamlit App

Welcome to the **Treasure Island Adventure** game! This is an interactive web-based game created using Python and Streamlit. Your mission is to make the right choices and find the treasure hidden on the island. Will you make it to the treasure, or will you face an unfortunate end? Try your luck and see!

## 📜 How to Play
The game is simple:
1. You start at a crossroad. Choose the correct direction to proceed.
2. You'll come across a lake — decide whether to wait or swim.

Be careful! One wrong move could lead to "Game Over."
